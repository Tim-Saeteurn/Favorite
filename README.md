Path of Exile is a free-to-play action role-playing video game developed and published by Grinding Gear Games. On this site I will be sharing some thing I enjoy about the game.

## 1. The Game is free to play!
You dont have to pay anything to play the game and it isn't pay to win meaning that you cannot progress past people by paying money. The game is mostly supported by cosmetics!
